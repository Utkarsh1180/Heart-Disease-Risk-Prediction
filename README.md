# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart Disease Risk Prediction is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.  

The model analyzes clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate to classify patients into:

- **1 → Heart Disease Present**
- **0 → No Heart Disease**

This project demonstrates the practical application of supervised learning in healthcare analytics and early disease detection.
